        <p>
        Recently graduate from Northwestern University, Full-Stack Web Developer and Salesforce Certified Administrator. I am highly motivated to start working as a web developer. </p>

        <p>My studies in Northwestern has given me a solid foundation for my coding skills. </p>

        <p>What I have learned is Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.js. I also have knowledge over packages such as JQuery, Handlebars, many APIâ€™s and Framework such as Bootstrap. Responsive design that looks as good on a mobile screen as a desktop PC has been a focus throught the bootcamp.</p>

        <p>Back-end I have learned Node.js, and created databases with both MongoDB and MySQL. I have also worked with several different npm packages on server-side and client-side.</p>

        <p>I am a Salesforce Certified Administrator working on my Salesforce App Builder and Web Developer I Certificate.</p>

        <p>Eager to learn, easy going by nature and confident with working with colleagues and managers. </p>
        <p>Currently looking for a suitable graduate web developer position with a progressive employer. Previous background includes medicine, after a career change into Software Development and Salesforce.</p>
