### Wikigames
Wikigames is a collaborative project with [Zac Jayes](https://github.com/ZJayes), [Mohammad Ali Karimi](https://github.com/karimi65), [Matt Kulling](https://github.com/mokulling) and me.

Wikigames allows users to search from a wide range of games and receive back an image of the game, a brief description, and a YouTube playlist of gameplay so that users can make an informed buying decision, or reminisce about their favorite retro games from the past. This website uses the RAWG games API for the game description and image, and the YouTube API for the YouTube modal and playlist.
